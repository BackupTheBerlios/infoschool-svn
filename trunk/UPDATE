 How to update
 
You have a running system and important data in the database.
So you do not want to delete the running version (with data) 
and install a new version.

1. Backup your data (files and database)
2. Replace the old files with the new.
3. Copy important files from your backup in the new directories.
   - .htsecret/*/*
   - htdocs/img/person/*
4. Run htdocs/setup/update/index.php. This will update your database.
