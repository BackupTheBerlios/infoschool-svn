installation and configuration

Now the hole project should be in the same directory as this file.
The webserver needs read access to the whole directory and write access to the following.
 .htsecret/*
 htdocs/img/person
 
Others should have read access to htdocs/ only.
 
At this point you may let infoschool configure itself:
 http://yourserver/directory_of_infoschool/setup/ 
 
Otherwise you may configure infoschool manual.
Everything you need is in .htsecret/etc/.
 cd .htsecret/etc/

You need to configuration files.
 cp tmpl/*.php ./
 
Now edit these two files.
 vi mysql.php
 vi random.php
 
Follow the comments in these files.

Infoschool needs MySQL access described in mysql.php. The inital data for the database are in the SQL files.
 mysql -u {user} -p {db} < tables.sql
 mysql -u {user} -p {db} < data.sql
 
Now you may login in infoschool with 'admin' as last name and no password, change the password and be happy about a complete installation. :)

The end
